# ArtixWSL
Artix Linux on WSL (Windows 10 FCU or later) based on [wsldl](https://github.com/yuk7/wsldl) and inspired by [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL)

## Abandonment/Deprecation Notice

This project is not used by its author anymore.

Automated nightly builds are still made, reported bugs may be fixed, and related questions answered.

Let me know if you actually used this thing and for what reasons. Just don't expect anything to always work anymore (as you shouldn't have in the first place).

As for alternatives, I'd recommend either [Distrod](https://github.com/nullpo-head/wsl-distrod) running provided Arch Linux image (used by me as of now); or the original [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) with one of the [systemd replacements](https://wsldl-pg.github.io/ArchW-docs/Known-issues/#systemdsystemctl).

Refer to [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) README for further instructions - most of it should also work for ArtixWSL

Note that this project is not affiliated with neither ArchWSL, Artix, nor any of these projects maintainers - bothering them with questions regarding ArtixWSL would make you look stupid and make them mad at both you and me.
